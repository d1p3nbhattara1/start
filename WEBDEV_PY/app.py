#that was the way to input a var value from user and concatinate to display

#we can use f strings for better results(avialable since python 3.1)

print(f"{n} ,  giga niiga") 
# here I did not even need to specift dtr(n) because of {n} take the actual data tyle and {} insde "" make its a string to concatiante
